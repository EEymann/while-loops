## Description

_This short program is a beginner's showcase on how to write a while loop. A simple random number generator function is used to make the while loop run. The loop is currently limited to a value of ten, meaning it can only run ten times. However, the programmer can change the number of loops the program runs simply by changing the value of the argument that is passed into the parameter call 'upper'._
